### WHAT IS THIS FILE?
# This file when recognized by a git client, will help enforce consistency
# across multiple environments/systems in regards to line endings(CRLF & LF).
# Documentation - `.gitattributes`: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes

# It provides fine-grained control in comparison to the `core.autocrlf` and
# `core.eol` git settings that may vary per system, while the `.gitattributes`
# file has a higher priority than `.gitconfig` and travels with the repository.
# Documentation - `.gitconfig`: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config


### WHY SHOULD I CARE?
# The desired result is to ensure the repo contains normalized LF line endings,
# notably avoiding unhelpful noise in diffs or issues incurred from mixed line
# endings. Storing as LF ensures no surprises for line endings during checkout.
# Additionally for checkout to the local working directory, line endings can be
# forced to CRLF or LF per file where appropriate, which ensures the files have
# compatible line endings where software expects a specific kind.


### ATTRIBUTES
# `text` normalizes the file(s) line endings to LF upon add/commit. (CRLF -> LF)
# `text=auto` sets `text` if Git decides the matched file is not binary data.

# `eol` enforces a line ending for a file when writing to the working directory.
# `core.autocrlf` when set to `true` or `input` overrides the `core.eol` value.
# `core.eol` is used for any files not explicitly set with an `eol` attr value.
# `core.eol` uses the native line endings for your platform by default.

# `binary` is an alias for `-text -diff`. The file won't be normalized(-text).
# `-diff` indicates not to show a diff. Useful when diffs are not likely to be
# meaningful such as generated content (SVG, Source Maps, Lockfiles).

# `export-ignore` excludes matched files and directories during `git archive`,
# which services like Github use to create releases of a project with.
